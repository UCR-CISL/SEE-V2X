## Dataset Overview
XXXX is a cross-layer dataset, which includes the application layer network traces generated by the C-V2X radio, C-V2X MAC layer trace and Sidelink control information captured by USRP B210. 

The dataset includes 4 catagories in total:
- Indoor_AllCombos
  - Include all the possible comniations of parameters as shown in the figure below. The data collection period for each test is around 30 seconds.

- Outdoor_ParkingLot
  - This is a preliminary simple outdoor test. There are two UEs in the parkinglot, one serves as a transmitter, the other one is serves as a receiver. This test lacks the GNSS coordinations.

- Indoor_Selective
  - We pick certain presentative cases and extend the data collection period to 1 hour. The data is collected in a typical indoor environment. The selective cases are shown in the figure below.

| Cases      | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scenarios  | The configuration is the same as the outdoor scenarios                                                                                             |
| Throughput | 4 TX are transmitting in priority 0, reservation 20 ms and the packet length if from 100-8000 bytes.                                               |
| IPG        | 4 TX are transmitting in priority 0, resevation 20ms, packet length 4000 bytes and  the packet generation interval is set from 10, 20, 50, 100 ms. |
| Priority   | 4 TX are transmitting in reservation 20 ms, packet length 4000 byts, packet generation interval is set to 20 ms and the priority is set from 0-7.  |


- Outdoor_Intersection
  - We picko 10 presentative cases and collect data in a busy intersection. This test has GNSS coordinations gotten from a high-end IMU, xsens.

### tx_[UE].csv
This file is the application layer trace of transmitter.
- equipment_id: The identity of the transmitter.
- seq_num: The transmitting packet sequence number.
- priority: The transmitting packet priority, which affects the C-V2X radio transmitting logic.
- timestamp: The transmitting packet timestamp.
- channel_busy_percentage: The channel busy percentage reported by the C-V2X radio.

### rx_[UE1]\_tx\_[UE2]\_[Application].csv
This is the end-to-end, receiver side application layer trace. The log is generated by UE1 and includes the E2E performance of UE2->UE1.
- rx_timestamp (us): The timestamp when the packet is received.
- latency (ms): Latency = rx_timestamp - tx_timestamp
- per_ue_loss_pct (%): The packet loss rate for different UEs.
- ipg (ms): The inner packet gap (jitter).
- tx_equipment_id: The identity of the transmitter.
- tx_seq_num: The sequence number of the transmitter.
- tx_priority: The transmitted packet priority.

### mac.csv
This is the C-V2X MAC layer trace captured by the USRP B210. 
MAC layer handles the radio resource management, scheduling, and the data link layer functions.
In C-V2X, there are additional source layer-2 IDs and destination layer-2 IDs in the MAC layer header to identify the transmitter and receiver.

### sci.csv
This is the sidelink control information captured by the USRP B210. SCI is an important information used in C-V2X to schedule the sidelink resources automatically between the UEs. The data in SCI.csv includes - timestamp: The timestamp in us when the USRP captures the SCI packet over the air.
- priority:
- resource_resv:
- freq_resourece:
- time_gap:
- mcs_idx:
- pscch_start:
- nof_prb:
- N_x_id:
For more details about the data mean in SCI, please refer to the 3GPP TS...

### GNSS
The GNSS data is collected by a high-end IMU, xsens. The data includes the latitude, longitude, altitude, and the timestamp. 

## Example usage
In the XX folder, we provide some basic utils to commute the average throughput, packet loss rate, etc. and some visualies tool.
For example, to visulize the channel utilization,
Run ```my script````. The example output is shown below.
The window is interacive, you can drag or zoom in/out.
